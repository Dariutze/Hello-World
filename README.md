# Hello-World
My first repository

Hey guys,

i'am Darius, 25 years old and im currently writing my bachelor thesis :D

I'am a business administration and electronic engineering student from Leipzig, Germany, and my plan is to develope a storage-management system for my company. This also gonna be the main part of my bachelor thesis.
My plan is to realise my project with Laravel, but so far i'm still learning to handle php properly. 

I'am a absolutly amateuer in terms of programming (We learn C once in university, but not really properly).

So I hope i can be a acceptable member of your community and can beg you from time to time for some help.
I mean when I'am totally lost and dont know how to continue XD

I'am excited to check out this new platform and a new community

That's all so far :) 

PS: I wanna apologize for all grammar and writing mistakes in advance XD

Peace
